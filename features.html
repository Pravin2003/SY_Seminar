                Cross-platform video editing software (Linux, Mac, and Windows)
            </h2>
            <p>
                OpenShot supports the following operating systems: Linux (most distributions are supported), Windows
                (version 7, 8, and 10+), and OS X (version 10.15+). Project files are also cross-platform, meaning you
                can save a video project in one OS, and open it on another. All video editing software features are
                available on all platforms.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Based on the powerful FFmpeg library, OpenShot can read and write most video and image formats. For a
                full list of supported formats, see the FFmpeg project. OpenShot's export dialog defaults to some of the
                more common formats, but with the advanced tab, you can use any FFmpeg format.

            <p>
                OpenShot comes with a powerful key frame animation framework, capable of an unlimited number of key
                frames and animation possibilities. Key frames interpolation mode can be quadratic bezier curves,
                linear, or constant, which determines how the animated values are calculated.

                <p>
                    Integration with the user's desktop is a key feature of OpenShot. Native file browsers, window
                    borders, and full drag and drop support with the native file system. Getting started is as easy as
                    dragging files into OpenShot from your favorite file manager.

                <p>
                    Tracks are used to layer images, videos, and audio in a project. You can create as many layers as
                    needed, such as watermarks, background audio tracks, background videos, etc... Any transparency will
                    show through the layer below it. Tracks can also be moved up, down, or locked.
