            <h2>Origin Story</h2>
            <p>The dramatic story of how and why OpenShot was created, is best understood by reading: <a
                    href="https://www.openshot.org/story/">Our Story.</a></p>
            <!-- <a href="#" class="main-btn">Download</a> -->
            <h2>Creator & Lead Developer</h2>
            <p>OpenShot was created in August 2008, by Jonathan Thomas, a software developer from North Texas (USA).
                However, Jonathan is now assisted by many key developers: Meet the Developers. In 2012, OpenShot
                Studios, LLC was incorporated by Jonathan Thomas, and all copyright and trademark properties were
                transferred to this new company, to better protect the interests of each contributor. Soon after,
                OpenShot Studios joined the Open Invention Network (OIN), in order to strengthen its ability to
                protect
                the contributors and source-code.</p>
            <h2>Programming Language & Dependencies</h2>
            <p>OpenShot is written in a few different programming languages. The interface is built with Python
                and
                PyQt5. Our video processing backend (libopenshot) is built in C++, and utilizes FFmpeg. Our
                interactive
                drag-n-drop timeline is built with HTML5, JavaScript, and AngularJS. Many of our advanced 3D
                effects and
                animations are powered by Blender.</p>
